### Modern Graph Theory Algorithms with Python_ Harness the power of graph algorithms and real-world network applications

A book written Colleen M. Farrelly and Franck Kalala Mutombo to "Master the power of graph theory and network science to solve complex, real-world problems with Python â€” from data wrangling and predictive modeling to advanced graph databases and graph neural networks. This comprehensive guide equips data scientists and engineers with practical algorithms, case studies, and scalable solutions for big data analytics across diverse domains such as finance, epidemiology, and social networks."

Here I use their codes and expand on it visually and adding explanatory summaries from the book, in addition to my own explnations from other research resources.

The plan is to prepare python and Cypher-python interfaced notebooked for resources such as: 
1. Chapters 8,9,10 of the book: Graph Powered Machine Learning written by Alessandro Negro
2. Academic papers such as: GOTCHA! Network-based Fraud Detection for Social Security Fraud by Van Vlasselaer et, al. 2014  

It's intresting how graph based Machine learning seriosuly died out even Andrew Ng stopped working on it, maybe this was one his last papers on the domain: [On Spectral Clustering: Analysis and an Algorithm](https://www.andrewng.org/publications/on-spectral-clustering-analysis-and-an-algorithm/)

One useful set of concepts is TDA: Topological data analysis where it studies surfaces in different dimentions. Graphs are technically are surfaces and alot of mathematical topological technics can also be implemented and can be considered as explainable algorithm for regularised industries such as banking or heathcare.
