### ðŸ§  Modern Graph Theory Algorithms with Python

**Harness the power of graph algorithms and real-world network applications**

This repository is inspired by the book *Modern Graph Theory Algorithms with Python* by **Colleen M. Farrelly** and **Franck Kalala Mutombo**. The book aims to:

> *"Master the power of graph theory and network science to solve complex, real-world problems with Python â€” from data wrangling and predictive modeling to advanced graph databases and graph neural networks. This comprehensive guide equips data scientists and engineers with practical algorithms, case studies, and scalable solutions for big data analytics across diverse domains such as finance, epidemiology, and social networks."*

In this project, I **expand on their code examples**, add **visualizations**, and provide **summarized explanations** drawn both from the book and from **external research sources**.
