### ðŸ§  Modern Graph Theory Algorithms with Python

**Harness the power of graph algorithms and real-world network applications**

This repository is inspired by the book *Modern Graph Theory Algorithms with Python* by **Colleen M. Farrelly** and **Franck Kalala Mutombo**. The book aims to:

> *"Master the power of graph theory and network science to solve complex, real-world problems with Python â€” from data wrangling and predictive modeling to advanced graph databases and graph neural networks. This comprehensive guide equips data scientists and engineers with practical algorithms, case studies, and scalable solutions for big data analytics across diverse domains such as finance, epidemiology, and social networks."*

In this project, I **expand on their code examples**, add **visualizations**, and provide **summarized explanations** drawn both from the book and from **external research sources**.

### ðŸ’­ Reflections on Graph Machine Learning

It's interesting how graph-based machine learning has somewhat faded from the spotlight â€” even **Andrew Ng** hasn't published much in this domain lately. One of his last major contributions in this area might have been:

### ðŸŒ€ Future Directions: TDA & Explainability

One powerful but underutilized set of tools is **Topological Data Analysis (TDA)** â€” the study of shapes, surfaces, and their properties across dimensions. Since **graphs can be treated as topological spaces**, many techniques from algebraic topology (e.g., **persistent homology**) can be adapted for use in **interpretable machine learning**, particularly in **regulated industries** like **banking** and **healthcare**.

I am planning also to build a hands-on, well-documented, and visually enriched set of Jupyter Notebooks and Cypher-Python interfaces based on:

1. **Chapters 8, 9, and 10** of the book *Graph-Powered Machine Learning* by **Alessandro Negro**
2. **Academic papers**, such as:

   * *GOTCHA! Network-based Fraud Detection for Social Security Fraud*
     *(Van Vlasselaer et al., 2014)*
