### Modern Graph Theory Algorithms with Python_ Harness the power of graph algorithms and real-world network applications

A book written Colleen M. Farrelly and Franck Kalala Mutombo to "Master the power of graph theory and network science to solve complex, real-world problems with Python â€” from data wrangling and predictive modeling to advanced graph databases and graph neural networks. This comprehensive guide equips data scientists and engineers with practical algorithms, case studies, and scalable solutions for big data analytics across diverse domains such as finance, epidemiology, and social networks."

Here I use their codes and expand on it visually and adding explanatory summaries from the book, in addition to my own explnations from other research resources.
